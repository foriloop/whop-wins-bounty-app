### 1. Whop Developer Setup

   - Sign up for a developer account
   - Create a new app

2. **Configure Your App**
   - Set **App Name**: "Win Rewards" (or your preferred name)
   - Set **Base URL**: Your deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Set **App Path** to `/` (not `/experiences/[experienceId]`)
   - Set **Discover Path**: `/discover`
   - Set **Webhook URL**: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks`

3. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Copy your **App ID** from the dashboard

   - Note your **Company ID** (found in your company settings)

### 2. Firebase Setup

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Click "Create a project"
   - Name your project (e.g., "whop-win-rewards")
   - Enable Google Analytics (optional)

2. **Enable Firestore Database**
   - In your Firebase project, go to "Firestore Database"
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" for now
   - Select a location close to your users

3. **Get Firebase Config**
   - Go to Project Settings > General
   - Scroll down to "Your apps"
   - Click the web icon (</>) to add a web app
   - Register your app and copy the config

4. **Set Up Security Rules**
   - Go to Firestore Database > Rules
   - Replace the rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
    
    // Wins are readable by all, writable by authenticated users
    match /wins/{winId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if true;
    }
    
    // Bounties are readable by all, writable by authenticated users
    match /bounties/{bountyId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Whop Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=your_whop_app_id_here
WHOP_API_KEY=your_whop_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID=your_whop_agent_user_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID=your_whop_company_id_here
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_whop_webhook_secret_here

# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace all `your_*_here` values with your actual credentials
- For `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID`, you can use your own Whop user ID or create a dedicated agent user
- Keep your `.env.local` file secure and never commit it to version control

### 4. Local Development

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Test Locally**
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should see the app with authentication required message
   - The app will work properly once deployed and accessed through Whop

### 5. Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Add all environment variables from your `.env.local` file
   - Deploy

3. **Get Your Deployment URL**
   - Note your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

### 6. Configure Whop App Settings

1. **Update Whop Dashboard**
   - Go back to your Whop Developer Dashboard
   - Update the **Base URL** to your Vercel deployment URL
   - **CRITICAL**: Make sure **App Path** is set to `/` (not `/experiences/[experienceId]`)
   - Update the **Webhook URL** to `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks`

2. **Test the Integration**
   - Go to your Whop company dashboard
   - Add the app to your company
   - Test the integration by accessing it through Whop

### 7. Create Your First Experience

1. **Access Through Whop**
   - Go to your Whop company dashboard
   - Find your app in the experiences section
   - Click to access it

2. **Test User Flow**
   - Users should be automatically authenticated
   - They should be able to submit wins
   - They should see the leaderboard and other features

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App showing "Experience Access" page instead of your app?**
- **SOLUTION**: Make sure your Whop app's "App Path" is set to `/` (not `/experiences/[experienceId]`)
- This is the most common issue that causes the experience management page to show

**App not loading in Whop?**
- Check that your Base URL is correct in Whop dashboard
- Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel
- Check Vercel deployment logs for errors

**Authentication not working?**
- Verify Whop API keys are correct
- Check Firebase configuration
- Ensure webhook secret is set correctly

**Database errors?**
- Verify Firebase project ID and API keys
- Check Firestore security rules
- Ensure Firestore is enabled

**Webhooks not working?**
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check webhook secret in environment variables
- Ensure webhook endpoint is accessible

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open developer tools
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check network requests

2. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Check function logs for API errors

3. **Check Firebase Console**
   - Go to Firebase console
   - Check Firestore for data
   - Look for any permission errors

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### User Flow
1. User accesses app through Whop
2. Whop provides authentication token
3. App validates token and creates/updates user
4. User can submit wins and earn points
5. Points can be converted to rewards

### Win Submission Process
1. User fills out win submission form
2. Win is stored in Firebase with "pending" status
3. Admin can review and approve/reject wins
4. Approved wins award points to user
5. Points contribute to leaderboard ranking

### Reward System
- Users earn points for approved wins
- Points can be converted to monetary rewards
- Leaderboard shows top performers
- Badge system provides additional motivation
